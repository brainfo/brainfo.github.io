## Genome wide TF binding

### SHARE-Seq

In the aim of interpreting the footprint, in my words, to build a DNA footprint database --> trans-element
<-- DL (inspired by dl)
![from DNA to footprints](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image.png)
> How stable are the footprint as DNA are stable? \\
> can it output pleipotrip footprints? \\
> the scanning params (padding)

--> use case
identify TFs that drive cell aging --> nucleosomes shift

### 3D spatial from "raw" 2nd seq

![illumina](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-1.png)
--> 3D reconstruction based on more raw photonic data
![3D reconstruct](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-2.png)
--> expand the *in situ* seq by introducing the expanded hydrogel --> data on microns or DNA distance from lamin

> coupling with lamin to study the chromatin structure is a convention

inactive "X" as an exampled biology to be studied with this

### Sumamry of chromatin resolution and techs

![summary](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-4.png)

### Discussion

ATAC replace ChIP
> but it's based on knowledge from ChIP

## open-ST

![summary-openST](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-6.png)
![summary-depth-throughput](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-7.png)
> 20,000 genes

from Nikolaus Rajewsky lab
![xeniumandvisium](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-5.png)

"3D virtual tissue block" \\
module cell segment, module transcripts, map modules

### biological output

3D boundary between cell types, for example, tumor cells and other cells

### Discussion

- sequencing-based has more varied complexed noises. Ideal for hypothesis generating
- imaging-based is ideal for validating the hypothesis.
  
## Rare cell type by na cytometry based PERFF-seq

Coleb Lareau

### study strategy

![strategy](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/strategy.png)

> how much they are differ from other non-rare type?

Criteria for sucessful assay
![criteria](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/rare.png)

Based on

1. RNA FISH
2. 10x Genomics Flex scRNA-seq, where cells are fixed
    > I didn't understand how seq on fixed cells bu two probes on one read

### benchmark using FC/RNA cytometry enrichment

### Biological output

1. enrich cells with TF expression
2. enrich with coding and ncRNA
3. rare cell types enrichment
4. FFEP and frozen tissues

### Discussion

1. easier with RNA vs DNA
2. initiate probes? ~ size of target gene
3. how many markers? limited by cell numbers but not markers

> I would say is the choice of orthogonal markers

## Single cell perturbation dictionaries

1. Chemical (cytokine stimulation)
   - Cui, wt al, Nature (2024)
    > I read this quite carefully already

2. Perturb-Seq
   - first cytokine stimulation
   - then fix and permeablize for perturb-seq (3 guides per gene for 40-60 genes)
  
### Analyzing

1. binarize perturbatoin output as in Nat Genet (2021)
2. imporve to continous score

## spatial and sc by Saturn and star-map

[github](https://github.com/wanglab-broad/spin) \\
[paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.30.547258v1)

### convention

1. smoothing *I missed how*
2. sc analysis
    neighbors are also spatial neighbors

### solution

1. **sample from multiple neighborhoods**
2. smoothing
3. sc analysis

## spatial-resolved sc genomics of human brain by Xiaowei Zhuang

1. space of cells in tissues
2. space of intra-cellular
3. space of chromasome

### Techs

1. MERFISH > 1k genes 2019 Technology

   1. error-robust bc
   2. combinatorial label
   3. sequential imaging

2. MERFISH extened to 3D genomics 2020

localize DNA loci > 1k genomic loci \\
    \+ > 1k nascent RNA \\
    \+ protein
3. extended to epigenomics

with antibody to Tn5 taged protein \\
in a gel so with proximal info \\
--> epigenetic markers
4. thick tissue 3D merfish

200 $/mu m$

### biology

1. Mouse brain cell atlas. related pub: Zhang et al., PMID 38092912 (2023)
somatic contact, paracrine signaling or short-range interactions compose cell-cell interaction
2. Human brain cell atlas

## Discussion

### human mouse diff (behaviral)

- not only from dense (human < 3x mouse)
- modulize effects
- loci to genomic to get chromosome organization by imaging
  - techniqually no problem to increase
  - **high density** in nucleus as a rate limiting --> more runs, so tedious
  - worth efforts
  - now mega base resolution --> higher resolution, you need more runs and sts, imaging time

> I didn't think of a way to get around this density

## Fixed Universal cell embeddings by Yanay Rosen

### Concepts

- e.g. put cells in one universal waddington landscape
- AI e.g. from CZI

### with this, we could model cellular change in silico

Represent cells with
    - representable expression matrix, e.g. low-dimensional embeddings
    - a sentence then can study with NLP
      - feature ordering?
    -  a bag of RNA (no order)
  > I would consider this is prior-free
       -  transformer
Represent genes
    - Excel (redicule)
    - Gene2Vec
    - chatgpt

**Solution:** \\
Gene represent adopting an aa model ESM

**Fixed*:* \\
NOT finetune, so called 0-shot
**Self-supervised**

### therefore

![model](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/model.png)
Output can be massive, and provides a universal space to be mapped
> how high dimension is this bag of RNA representation space
