## The step rocket of giving birth

The placenta is jettisoned after birth as the stages of rocket is jettisoned. No one will deny the importance of the stage’s importance for a rocket to reach its orbit.  
We study the placenta at full term. It’s like to study the stages when they fall back on earth.  
Although the stages back on earth have gone through the atmosphere again and are not exactly the same as when they are connected to the rocket, it still carries most information with regard to the main structure and mechanism that propel the rocket. The same applies to our placenta studies. We can tell how the placenta support the embryonic development and protect the fetus from Immunol attack.  
Once we understand more about how the placenta transmits the maternal condition to the offspring health, it will be more convenient to design therapies that target the placenta for the health of the offspring and mothers.  
The quality of the stages have huge impact on the success of the rocket launcher, so do the placenta for the success pregnancy.
