# Anaconda

## check version
When you log in to an Ubuntu system for the first time, before doing any work it is always a good idea to check what version of Ubuntu is running on the machine.
what I really need:
```{sh}
hostnamectl
```
```{sh}
 Static hostname: ubuntu
         Icon name: computer-vm
           Chassis: vm
        Machine ID: 7ec60286722d41848f03e024d13c84bc
           Boot ID: 50940574f5094fcd948aee8532dce843
    Virtualization: vmware
  Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
            Kernel: Linux 4.18.0-15-generic
      Architecture: x86-64
```

## 更新系统

## Anaconda 安装
**现在conda国内镜像都已停用，我是为了更方便的多版本管理继续使用的。因为其他多版本管理的工具我看不懂**
1. 下载
2. 验证MD5
```sh
md5sum ./Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh
43caea3d726779843f130a7fb2d380a2
```

3. 安装
```sh
bash ./Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

> We recommend you accept the default install location.

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

>  To run conda from anywhere without having the base environment activated by default, use conda config --set auto_activate_base False. 

4. check naviagtor
```sh
anaconda-navigator
```

## conda directory structure
```sh
which anaconda
```
```sh
/home/song_adm/anaconda2/bin/anaconda
```
更改权限
但是在更新过程中发现服务器的conda实际在
```sh
/usr/local/anaconda3
```

- ROOT_DIR
The directory that Anaconda or Miniconda was installed into.
EXAMPLES:
`/opt/Anaconda #Linux`

    - /pkgs
Also referred to as PKGS_DIR. This directory contains decompressed packages, ready to be linked in conda environments. Each package resides in a subdirectory corresponding to its canonical name.
    - /envs
The system location for additional conda environments to be created.
The following subdirectories comprise the default Anaconda environment:
    - /bin
    -  /include
    - /lib
    - /share

Other conda environments usually contain the same subdirectories as the default environment.


## channels
[官方doc][3]
conda-forge
bioconda
defaults
[清华镜像][4]

查看channels:
```sh
conda config --show
```
## 更新
```sh
conda update -n base conda
```
## jupyter notebook
- leave for yourself

加入r环境
**当前工作环境**
```sh
conda install -c r r-essentials
#用这个
conda create -n r_env r-essentials r-base
```

>  Jupyter 还有可以让你在同一个代码框，同时写python代码和R代码的方法

## conda environment
A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages that you have installed. For example, you may have one environment with NumPy 1.7 and its dependencies, and another environment with NumPy 1.6 for legacy testing. **If you change one environment, your other environments are not affected.** You can easily activate or deactivate environments, which is how you switch between them. **You can also share your environment with someone by giving them a copy of your environment.yaml file.**
