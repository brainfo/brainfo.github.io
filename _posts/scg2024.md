## Genome wide TF binding

### SHARE-Seq

In the aim of interpreting the footprint, in my words, to build a DNA footprint database --> trans-element
<-- DL (inspiyed by dl)
![from DNA to footprints](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image.png)
> How stable are the footprint as DNA are stable? \\
> can it output pleipotrip footprints? \\
> the scanning params (padding)

--> use case
identify TFs that drive cell aging --> nucleosomes shift

### 3D spatial from "raw" 2nd seq

![illumina](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-1.png)
--> 3D reconstruction based on more raw photonic data
![3D reconstruct](/img/in-post/post-scg2024/image-2.png)
--> expand the *in situ* seq by introducing the expanded hydrogel --> data on microns or DNA distance from lamin

> coupling with lamin to study the chromatin structure is a convention

inactive "X" as an exampled biology to be studied with this

### Sumamry of chromatin resolution and techs

### Discussion

ATAC replace ChIP
> but it's based on knowledge from ChIP

## open-ST

"3D virtual tissue block" \\
module cell segment, module transcripts, map modules

### biological output

3D boundary between cell types, for example, tumor cells and other cells

### Discussion

- sequencing-based has more varied complexed noises. Ideal for hypothesis generating
- imaging-based is ideal for validating the hypothesis.
