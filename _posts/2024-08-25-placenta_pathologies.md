## Placenta Pathologies to look for

### Villouse Maldevelopment

Three types of maldevelopment:
![General types](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-8.png)

Examples

- immature intermediate villi in term placentas. a) normal. b) more homogeneously distributed **immature** intermediate villi

![immature example x15](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-9.png)

- The **chronic preplacental hypoxia** causes prevalence of branching angiogenesis, resulting in multiply branched and indented terminal villi. a) x120 intense trophoblastic knotting as a result of increased b) x300 artifactual syncytial knotting and bridging
![hypoxia](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-10.png)
conglomeration of terminal villi with apparent syncytial “bridging” and “sprouting” artifactually, caused by tangential sectioning.

- **IUGR and postplacental hypoxia**

### Hispathological approach to Villous alteration

- Villi development
  - accelerated
  ![accelerated maturation x64](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-3.png)
  - accelerated maturity ( at left ) with numerous syncytial knots associated with small terminal villi and large immature intermediate villi at the right
    ![development x64](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-5.png)
- inflammation
  - chorangiosis
    ![chorangiosis x160](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-1.png)
    ![grade 2 chorangiosis x90](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-2.png)
  - fibrosis
  ![fibrosis x160](/img/in-post/post-pathology/image-4.png)
  - large Hofbaucer cells in the edematous villus
    ![hofbaucer x160](image.png)
  - destroyed hofbaucer cells: The villi exhibit partly normal immature reticular stroma with an abundance of macrophages (Hofbauer cells, dark cells in reticular spaces), which is normal for immature intermediate villi. In other villi, the reticular pattern is partially destroyed by various degrees of edema.

  - infiltration of chronic in fl ammatory cells
