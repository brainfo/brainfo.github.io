## Discussion (dev ver)
The field of bi-sexual reproduction sees three senaria according to the strength of argument.   
1. inheritage studies, in which the perturbation/mutation in inheritable elements in xx oocytes and/or sperms in one generation. (either peizi during adulthood or PGCs fromation during embryogeneis, either random mutation, neo mutation or induced by external environment or utero environment) In these studies, the inheritable elements are examined in two xx: First, the physical material itself (and the information it conveys) is stably preserved across generations compared to the mutation rate in one generation, so that the inheritaged information does not decay too quickly. Second, the decay rate is slow enough to allow natural selection impact. i.e. The material can sustain the number of generations that the it's presence in the species is selectively adjusted by the fitness to the natural environment.
2. The mediators of similar effects exposed to the same environmental conditions via a self-sustainable mediator-environment cycle.
