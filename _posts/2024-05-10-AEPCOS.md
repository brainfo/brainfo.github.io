## Testosterone and immune

### Masculinizing hormone therapy

n=23  XX — 0-12 month

Profile immune system by

- Mass cytometry
  - pDC⬇️ CD141+DC⬆️ MDSC⬇️ Monocytes⬇️
- bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq
  - IFNa
- **Olink**
  - inflammatory: CXCL9, OSM, TNF, RANKL, S100A12, TRAIL
    ![p11](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/p11.png)

### in-vitro functional test (cellular)

4h TLR7/8 —> scRNA profile

pDC: IFNa ⬇️ , Type-I and Hallmark IFNa

Monocyte: Hallmark IFNa⬇️

### PCOS

- low grade inflammation
- asthma
- SARS-COV2, COVID19

n=58 control, n=108 PCOS, 

![p13](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/p13.png)

→ Olink

→ metbaolic markers: HOMA_IR, BMI (~CSF1, PDL1), SHBG

→ reproductive markers: testosterone, FGscore, LH

**correlation between metabolic and reproductive markers lost in PCOS**

testosterone, positive with immune marker in control, negative in PCOS

??cells: CSF1, CCL2, 

myeloid cells: IL-6, S100A12, OSM

?? cells: S10A12, OSM

—> IL-18, IL18R1 —> TYPE 1 IMMUNE RESPONSE

—> turning down immune ??

MYELOID CELL ACTIVATION, INFLAMMASOME SIGANLING AND IMMUNE EXHASUTION

### QA

Q1: from genetics, testestrone not the driver?
Q2: transman vs man
    Not completely switched

## PCOS endometrium

proinflammatory Macrophage <- ?? cell type
antiflammatory Macrophage <- ?? cell type

hyperandrogenism --> immune functions --> insulin + xx (androgen?)

mice model: normal weight PCOS

in uterus eosinophil⬇️ （Eotaxin⬇️, IL5 not changed）
NK matruation (with markers) ⬆️

Adipose tissue

- eosinophole ⬇️ in visceral adipose tissue
- CD69+ NK ⬇️
- mature NK ⬇️

## Testosterone on TLR in transmen

### Background

TLR higher in female, TLR7/8 on chrX, GAHT on immune (Gap and Aim)

### Methods and results

Prospective observatory study, 21 transmen,

karyotype + RT-PCR for TLRs（8, 10 ⬇️）, CD144, MD2 ⬆️

## Prepubertal Primate model and Immune function

### primate models and metabolism

2.5 yo --> 5.5 yo

- chow
- T+chow
- WSD
- T+WSD

-> fetility trials (util 7yo)
-> reversal with chow to 7.5 yo

---- functional dissection
-- 3 yo treatment (not sig. until 2 yo)

- T+WSD: fasting insulin HOMA-IR BW (BV,VF), FFA update, lipolysis ⬆️ 
- NOT with individual treatments
- innate immunity and TLRs
  
-- 7 yo treatment and 0.5 yo reverse

### another cohort to focus on immune

1 yo treatment (from 6 yo to 7 yo)

- chow
- T+WSD
--> metabolism & immune

- adipocyty% changed
- C-peptide and CCL5 not changed

--> immune cells in peripheral tissues and blood by FC with

- lymphoid surface
- macrophage surface
- TLR stimulation cytokine response
NOT significant

--> macrophage response to TLR1/2

control response in IL6⬆️, and %CD11b+HLA-DR+cells

--> T cells
not significant changes

--> memory T cells
Tn, Tcm, Tem (CD28, CD95)
in omental fat, CD8+ effector memory cells ⬇️ by hyperandrogenemia, coor with HOMA-IR in OM-FAT
*WSD alone does not alter*
