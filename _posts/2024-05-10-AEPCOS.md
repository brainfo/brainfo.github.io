## Testosterone and immune

### Masculinizing hormone therapy

n=23  XX — 0-12 month

Profile immune system by

- Mass cytometry
  - pDC⬇️ CD141+DC⬆️ MDSC⬇️ Monocytes⬇️
- bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq
  - IFNa
- **Olink**
  - inflammatory: CXCL9, OSM, TNF, RANKL, S100A12, TRAIL
    ![p11](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/p11.png)

### in-vitro functional test (cellular)

4h TLR7/8 —> scRNA profile

pDC: IFNa ⬇️ , Type-I and Hallmark IFNa

Monocyte: Hallmark IFNa⬇️

![p12](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/p12.png)

### PCOS

- low grade inflammation
- asthma
- SARS-COV2, COVID19

n=58 control, n=108 PCOS, 

![p13](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/p13.png)

→ Olink

→ metbaolic markers: HOMA_IR, BMI (~CSF1, PDL1), SHBG

→ reproductive markers: testosterone, FGscore, LH

**correlation between metabolic and reproductive markers lost in PCOS**

testosterone, positive with immune marker in control, negative in PCOS

??cells: CSF1, CCL2, 

myeloid cells: IL-6, S100A12, OSM

?? cells: S10A12, OSM

—> IL-18, IL18R1 —> TYPE 1 IMMUNE RESPONSE

—> turning down immune ??

MYELOID CELL ACTIVATION, INFLAMMASOME SIGANLING AND IMMUNE EXHASUTION

### QA

Q1: from genetics, testestrone not the driver?
Q2: transman vs man
    Not completely switched

## PCOS endometrium

proinflammatory Macrophage <- ?? cell type
antiflammatory Macrophage <- ?? cell type

hyperandrogenism --> immune functions --> insulin + xx (androgen?)

mice model: normal weight PCOS

in uterus eosinophil⬇️ （Eotaxin⬇️, IL5 not changed）
NK matruation (with markers) ⬆️

Adipose tissue

- eosinophole ⬇️ in visceral adipose tissue
- CD69+ NK ⬇️
- mature NK ⬇️

## Testosterone on TLR in transmen

### Background

TLR higher in female, TLR7/8 on chrX, GAHT on immune (Gap and Aim)

### Methods and results

Prospective observatory study, 21 transmen,

karyotype + RT-PCR for TLRs（8, 10 ⬇️）, CD144, MD2 ⬆️

## Prepubertal Primate model and Immune function

### primate models and metabolism

2.5 yo --> 5.5 yo

- chow
- T+chow
- WSD
- T+WSD

-> fetility trials (util 7yo)
-> reversal with chow to 7.5 yo

---- functional dissection
-- 3 yo treatment (not sig. until 2 yo)

- T+WSD: fasting insulin HOMA-IR BW (BV,VF), FFA update, lipolysis ⬆️ 
- NOT with individual treatments
- innate immunity and TLRs
  
-- 7 yo treatment and 0.5 yo reverse

### another cohort to focus on immune

1 yo treatment (from 6 yo to 7 yo)

- chow
- T+WSD
--> metabolism & immune

- adipocyty% changed
- C-peptide and CCL5 not changed

--> immune cells in peripheral tissues and blood by FC with

- lymphoid surface
- macrophage surface
- TLR stimulation cytokine response
NOT significant

--> macrophage response to TLR1/2

control response in IL6⬆️, and %CD11b+HLA-DR+cells

--> T cells
not significant changes

--> memory T cells
Tn, Tcm, Tem (CD28, CD95)
in omental fat, CD8+ effector memory cells ⬇️ by hyperandrogenemia, coor with HOMA-IR in OM-FAT
*WSD alone does not alter*

![summary-p4](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/p4.png)

## 11-oxygenated androgens in PCOS

chronic kidney disease (Hsd) -> 11-oxygenated androgens⬇️

### methods

- oral DHEA (n=10)
- oral 11KA4 (97% purity) (n=10)
-> androgen metabolism
-> insulin resistance [2-step (low -> high dose insulin) hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp]

### results

D7:

- DHEA: [classic] A4, T, DHT; DHEA ⬆️, 11KA4: not change
- [11O androgen pathway] 11OHA4, 11KA4, 11OHT, (urinay) 11OHAn, 11OHRt, ... ⬆️ in 11KA4, not in DHEA
- insulin resistance, neither changed

### QA-p5

- dosage effects
- adipose tissue (no), muscle biopses (on going): data awaited
- clinical concern: androgen to high-androgen pcos women; side effects after D7?
  three month DHEA before IVF, so probably no side effects with 7 days  oral treatment

## Kispeptin as a test of hupothalamic function in women with oligo-amenorrhea

Presenter: Bijal Patel

menstrual disturbance (1/5) <- PCOS/HA(hypothalamic amenorrhoea)M- low bw, excessive exercise, ??, ??
difficulty in differentiation

both have divergent hypothalanic function:

GnRh frequency： PCOS:  ⬆️, HA: ⬇️

congenital structural aberrance (CHH)

### Results from kisspeptin given

kisspeptin-54 9.6nmol/kg: ⬆️LH and FSH
in PCOS, the LH response similar to control; **FSH reduced compared to control**

Influencers by correlation:
**Inhibin B; AMH**
**obesity** increase LH and FSH response

Clinical lean PCOS; different after kispeotin vs HA

My question: discriminate three group AUCROC? PCOS vs CHH?

My guess: too obvious so no need clinically?

## prenatal testosterone and offspring body composition (7yo)

[**Odense child cohort**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33477047/)
![odense flowchart](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/p7.png)
testosterone --> fetus (free testestrone ⬆️ from 3rd trimester)

monkeys: ⬆️abdominal fat mass in females

- mother: total by LC-MS/MS; free by -SHBG; diagnosis
- children: Fat%
- *DAG*: factor analysis

### results in boys

free testosterone ~ BMI, Fat mass index ⬆️； lean ⬇️ 

### results in girls

NOT as significant in the sig. changes in boys

maternal PCOS ~ gynoid fat%⬇️ only

### QA-p7

- why corrected for birth weight, but not taking as interaction
- Androgen/Estrogen ratio

## Kidneys in PCOS

renal injury, AR ⬆️-> IL-6⬆️ ->(STAT)-> mitochondra

Other reference:
[placental stat3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25609240/)

so maybe we could look into IL-6/mitochondra (not feasible in the current project but future) in our PCOS project?

### mice experiment

- veh 
- pcos (DHT): IL-6, JAK1/2, STAT ⬆️, STAT inhibitors⬇️
- STAT3 inhibitor 
  - normal levels in the aforementioned expression
  - complex I, II, III, IV-; mtROS -> mitochondra dysfunction restore
  - renal injury restore

### cellular experiments

DHT on renal cells

## immune-metabolism and pregnancy loss

Tregs - uNK

Tregs  deficiency in early pregnancy failure (EPF)

- %Trreg/CD$+T
- CTLA+ (suppressive marker)
- /Th1 and /Th17

EPF upregulated in Treg pro-inflammatory
1/4 are FOXP3 targets

Q: if cellular abundance lower but transcription abundance increase; so much more increased from the cells?

### Insulin/glycemic <--> inflammmation/immune tolerance

fasting and OGTT at 6w mid-phase post-miscarriage (at least 2 times, n=64) & T cell

- HOMA-IR ⬆️ (insulin resistance)
  - not alter CD4+ & CD8+ T cell abundance, not Treg neither
  - reduce HLADR+CTLA4+HELLOs+ (suppressive markers)
  - reduce proliferating Treg (Ki67)
  - increase naive CCR7+CD45RA+ Treg
  - reduce central memory and effector memory Treg
with genetically normal fetuses

### targeted therapies

cluster of patients with immune and metabolic dysregulation

## cytokines in PCOS pregnancy

presenter: Eszter Vanky

### immune develppment in PCOS vs. normal

- Normal (n=258):inflammation --> anti --> inflammation
- PCOS (n=358)
![eszter](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/eszter-1.png)
inflammatory and growth cytokines
![eszter-2](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/eszter-2.png)
In PCOS-placebo
Score PC1, contributors: Eolaxin, IL-4, IL-17, PDGF-BB, FGF-b (decrease through pregnancy); IL-13, IL-IRa, ... (increase through pregnancy)
![eszter-3](/img/in-post/post-aepcos/eszter-3.png)
Also with mobility analysis
- overweight/obesity
  - IL-IRa
  - CRP
- hyperandrogenism
  - FGF-b
  - IL-2
  - IL-16
  - IL-8
- fetal sex
  - meta-analysis with >12m individuals: male more PE and preterm
- metformin
  - increase immune, eolaxin, FGF-b, IL-17, IL-4, ...
  - less viral infection and allover infection
- children at 7 yo
  - higher allergy and eczema from metformin

Now I have controlled fetal sex, or maternal BMI, two batches of analysis; but not both of them. Maybe I should just try one batch with both controlled.

In combination with our data, probably the effects to the offspring could be directly to the fetus, not really from placenta.
