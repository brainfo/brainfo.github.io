## Revealing cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the placenta in obesity and its role in fetal programming
### Abstract
High maternal weight is associated with detrimental outcomes for both mothers and offspring, including increased risk of abortion and susceptibility to large baby weight. Few studies have investigated potential sex-biased mechanisms in the adaptation to the utero environment at the cell type resolution. Here, we conducted single nucleus sequencing from a cohort of matched third-trimester human samples and revealed cell type-specific transcriptome-wide changes in male and female placental tissue in response to high maternal triglyceride levels (a proxy for obesity). We found that proliferative cytotrophoblast (pCTB) and a small proportion of early syncytiotrophoblast (eSCTs) which could fuse into SCT layers remains in third-trimester placenta. We showed that syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) degradation is more pronounced in placenta larger than average weight (LAGA) male babies born to obese mothers. Specifically, we observed an increased proportion of Hoffbauer cells with lower SPP1 gene expression and higher XIST expression, suggesting a decreased response to testosterone and an increased susceptibility to spontaneous abortion in these babies. Further, more genes were perturbed in pCTB, cytotrophoblast (CTB), and SCT from female LAGA babies born to obese mothers, while more were perturbed in eSCT and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) from male babies. These findings uncover a placenta-dependent mechanisms through which maternal obesity can impact baby weight in a sex-specific manner.
