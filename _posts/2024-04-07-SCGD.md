This is a recap from SCGD 2024. With a very concise list of concepts that catch my eye and my comments in quotes.

## Rahul Satija
Single-cell genomics: Recent advances and future directions
1. in-silico "experiments"
2. sample size > cell numbers
   > think about what matters to you, detecting scarce cell type or information from major cell types (perturbation onto major cell type )? Most of my cases would be the latter.
   > Prior investigation on "how" to lower cell number per sample, project specific (sample quality and property play a part) remains to be done.

## 	Samantha Morris
New genomic technologies to deconstruct and control cell identity
1. "Dead end" and "reprogramming permissive state"
2. computation infill the gap between sampling and experimental measurement to the "truth".
    > I always say that our field exists only because of the limitations of experimental technology.

## Sten Linnarsson
Cellular diversity of the developing and adult human nervous system
- dissection-dissection correlation
  > Very good insights one can get from an "atlas" study

- Gaussian mixture model clusters and Topics
- Representative sampling, based on factors contributing to phenotypes most
  - e.g. sex, if really want to dissect, need large sample sizes. If you have not enough samples, no point in sex-specific analysis
> prior knowledge on factors contributing to phenotypes to guide study design before initiating projects
