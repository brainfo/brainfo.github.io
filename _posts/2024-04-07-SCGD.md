## Rahul Satija
Single-cell genomics: Recent advances and future directions
1. in-silico "experiments"
2. sample size > cell numbers
   > My comment: think about what matters to you, detecting scarce cell type or information from major cell types (perturbation onto major cell type )? Most of my cases would be the latter.
## 	Samantha Morris
New genomic technologies to deconstruct and control cell identity
1. "Dead end" and "reprogramming permissive state"
2. computation infill the gap between sampling and experimental measurement to the "truth".
    > My comment: I always say that our field exists only because of the limitations of experimental technology.
