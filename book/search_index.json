It will be continuously updated throughout my PhD years. From my current experience: bioconductor has more solid basement of biological (annotation) data questions and methods to tackle them (except for dl) are usually first developed in R, then the python community would propose competing methods. Since seruat comes earlier than scanpy the scanpy community evolves fast but somehow the developers are not considering better integrating each other’s new features packages in R is in general easier to use, though I personally is more used to python and could adapt more myself R utils are too easily to crash with the same hardware facility, same data size and same kind of job 1.1 Comments on snRNA-seq vs scRNA-seq advantages of snRNA-seq: does not require the preservation of cellular integrity during sample preparation, especially dissociation. disadvantages of snRNA-seq: loss of biological signal for genes with little nuclear localization. Interpretation of DE results: assumption: nuclear abundances are a good proxy for the overall expression profile. considerations: transcripts for strongly expressed genes might localize to the cytoplasm for efficient translation and subsequently be lost upon stripping genes with the same overall expression but differences in the rate of nuclear export may appear to be differentially expressed between clusters In the most pathological case, higher snRNA-seq abundances may indicate nuclear sequestration of transcripts for protein-coding genes and reduced activity of the relevant biological process, contrary to the usual interpretation of the effect of upregulation. "],["preprocess.html", "Chapter 2 Preprocess 2.1 Empty droplets", " Chapter 2 Preprocess In this chapter, we deal with empty droplets, ambient RNAs and doublets, especially in snRNA-seq setting. 2.1 Empty droplets We have no prior knowledge about whether a particular library (i.e., cell barcode) corresponds to cell-containing or empty droplets. Thus, we need to call cells from empty droplets based on the observed expression profiles. This is not entirely straightforward as empty droplets can contain ambient (i.e., extracellular) RNA that can be captured and sequenced, resulting in non-zero counts for libraries that do not contain any cell. The aim of empty droplets detection in most cases is to retains nucleus that would have been discarded by other threshold on total counts. 2.1.1 DropletUtils DropletUtils implemented utils to distinguish empty droplets and barcode swapping. Here we focused on empty droplet detection: 0. filter out genes with counts of zero for all barcodes 1. estimate the profile of the ambient RNA pool (default as gene count across barcodes with total counts &lt; 100) 2. test each barcode for deviations from this profile using a Dirichlet-multinomial model of UMI count sampling 2.1 Barcodes with significant deviations are considered to be genuine cells 2.2 Use a knee point filter to ensure that barcodes with large total counts are always retained 2.1.2 Cellbender Cellbender provides a deep generative model of background-contaminated counts. The model is used for learning the background RNA profile, distinguishing cell-containing droplets from empty ones, and retrieving background-free gene expression profiles. The model schema and network representation can be found in Figure 1g,h This method has been benchmarked with UMI counts thresholding and DecontX but not DropletUtils ## Ambient contamination I tested the combinations of the aforementioned empty droplets and ambient RNA detection methods (See diagram) with our in-house data and I’m convinced that Cellbender and cluster-based methods are of advantage.
